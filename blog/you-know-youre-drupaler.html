          <p>...when you go to your first local Drupal User Group meeting and think it's cool to hang out in IRC trying (although not always succeeding) to help other people while talking geek stuff.</p>
          <p>And so was my first experience with the <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/ann-arbor">Ann Arbor Drupal User Group</a>.</p>
          <p>I went there at the appointed time and quickly felt at home sharing my Drupal experiences with others whom I barely knew. I knew one or two things myself, but they had much more experience than me in pretty much every area, and the beauty of open source was presented to me for the first time in real life. Before today, it was all online for me. Then and there I realized that there's actual, real-life value to this stuff.</p>
          <p>Well, after a few hours trying to solve an interestingly weird problem, we decided to call it a night and go across the street to Bar Louie. Beer was good, food was free, and the conversation was diverse and highly entertaining.</p>
          <p>Even though I missed an <a href="http://msalsa.blogspot.com/">M-Salsa</a> Monday, I went home happy knowing that it was worth it.</p>
          <p>I'm looking forward to the next meeting!</p>
