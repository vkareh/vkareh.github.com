          <h3>nid in $form_state</h3>
          <div id="post-date">December 7, 2010</div>
          <p>The other day I had an interesting "chicken-and-egg" problem. I'm creating a new module that does the following:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>A user creates a node</li>
            <li>The node creation generates a list of follow-up nodes (with references to itself) to be created by the user at a later date</li>
            <li>When the user goes to create these follow-up nodes, the list should be updated to include the nid of both nodes, and which follow-up sequence this was for</li>
          </ol>
          <p>This all [mostly] worked well, with one exception: if I add a <code>$form['#submit'][] = 'my_submit_function';</code>, it runs <em>before</em> the <code>node_form_submit()</code> happens, in which case I don't have the node ID to store. But I also needed to pass the follow-up sequence as a hidden variable in the form, URL, or anywhere.</p>
          <p><strong>So, if I use the submit function, I have the $form_state, but not the node ID. If I use the hook_nodeapi(), I have the node ID, but not the form state.</strong></p>
          <p>One workaround I found was to use then <code>$form['buttons']['submit']['#submit'][] = 'my_submit_function';</code> and that worked wonderfully!</p>
          <p>I wasn't satisfied, though.</p>
          <p>My intention is to make this module as generic as possible, which means that someone using it might decide to, say, <em>remove the submit button!</em>, in which case my plan to take over the node fails.</p>
          <p>I was left with backtracking the <code>node_form_submit()</code> until where it's actually saved. Surprise! I realized that at some point something like this happens: <code>$node = $form_state['values'];</code> &lt;-- WARNING: that's not what happens for real!</p>
          <p>But you get the idea.</p>
          <p>What that means is that <code>$form_state['values']</code> is actually the $node object during node insert/update. Victory! The entire thing worked as follows:</p>
<pre>
function my_form_alter(&$form, &$form_state, $form_id) {
  $form['hiddenvalue'] = array(
    '#type' => 'value',
    '#value' => 'some value here',
  );
}
function my_nodeapi(&$node, $op, $a3, $a4) {
  switch ($op) {
    case 'insert':
    case 'update':
      dpm($node->hiddenvalue); // prints 'some value here' ... Yay!
      break;
  }
}
</pre>
          <p>Keep in mind that this <code>$node->hiddenvalue</code> will only exist within the context of the node submission. Mainly during <code>hook_nodeapi</code>, where <code>$op</code> is either <em>insert</em> or <em>update</em>. If you load the node from the database, that <em>hiddenvalue</em> won't be there, of course.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>What other scenarios can you think where this would be useful?</li>
            <li>What other ways have you found to get the <em>nid</em> from within the submit function?</li>
          </ul>
