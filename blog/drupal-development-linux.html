          <h3>Drupal development in Linux</h3>
          <div id="post-date">October 2, 2010</div>
          <p>I am a happy Linux user. I have been using different flavors of Linux for almost a decade now, and haven't seen Windows since the days of XP Service Pack 1. All my coworkers use Apple products (am I the only web developer that has never owned an Apple product, ever?)</p>
          <p>I eventually settled on Ubuntu for desktop use, although my web server runs CentOS.</p>
          <p>In any case, I swear by <a href="http://www.vim.org/about.php">vi</a>. And for most tasks, it's all I need for Drupal module development.</p>
          <p>However, I'm always on the look for awesome development tools or different ways of doing development. I keep going back and forth between the *nix way (one tool per task) and the IDE (one tool for <em>all</em> tasks).</p>

          <h4>The one-tool-per-task approach</h4>
          <p>This one is easy: fire up a terminal and here are the tools of the trade...</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Directory browsing: <strong>cd</strong>, <strong>ls</strong></li>
            <li>File manipulation: <strong>cp</strong>, <strong>mv</strong>, <strong>rm</strong></li>
            <li>Searching: <code><strong>find . -name "*" -print0 | xargs -0 grep -iIns "<em>KEYWORD</em>"</strong></code> (I have this whole command aliased to "search")</li>
            <li>Source version control: <strong>cvs</strong>, <strong>svn</strong>, <strong>git</strong></li>
            <li>Text editor: <strong>vi</strong></li>
          </ul>
          <p>There's nothing else to this. I don't really do a lot of debugging, apart from <a href="http://drupal.org/project/devel"><code>dpm($var);</code></a>. And the rest is, of course, a web browser.</p>

          <h4>Middle-tier</h4>
          <p>There is always the "halfway through" approach. Back in my <a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a> days, I used to love <a href="http://quanta.kdewebdev.org/">Quanta</a>, but the project has been abandoned. Now that I use <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a>, <a href="http://bluefish.openoffice.nl/">Bluefish</a> tends to be my editor of choice.</p>
          <p>Even with these tools, I still revert to the terminal to execute remote commands and do source control tasks (apart from <a href="http://live.gnome.org/giggle">Giggle</a>, which actually works very well).</p>
          <p>Here I should note that debugging is still done through a combination of the Devel module and WebKit's Web Inspector in <a href="http://www.chromium.org/Home">Chromium</a> and <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/epiphany/">Epiphany</a>.</p>

          <h4>One tool to rule them all</h4>
          <p>So far, no one has sat down to write a good <em>native</em> IDE for web development that's as feature-complete as <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a>. The emphasis is on the word <em>native</em>... and that means either <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/">QT</a> for KDE, or <a href="http://www.gtk.org/">GTK+</a> for GNOME.</p>
          <p>Since such a tool doesn't exist, I have to suck it up and install Ã¼ber-bloated Java libraries to run Eclipse. Sigh.</p>
          <p>There's nothing in Eclipse that I cannot do using a terminal and the proper commands. However, there are two features that really make it worthwhile to use Eclipse:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The <em>Open Declaration</em> functionality, where you Ctrl+click on a function to take you to its declaration; and</li>
            <li>Integrated debugging, where you don't have to leave the comfort of your IDE to see what's going on during runtime.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Truth is, with Eclipse, you don't have to leave the comfort of your IDE for <em>any</em> task, apart from opening a web browser.</p>
          <p>As I write, I'm installing all the Eclipse plugins I will need to accomplish this. In my next post I will walk through everything I did to set it up for doing Drupal development in pretty much any situation.</p>
