          <h3>Data dictionary for Drupal content types</h3>
          <div id="post-date">November 18, 2008</div>
          <p>This <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a> module displays your <a href="http://drupal.org/project/cck">CCK</a> content type fields along with their descriptions in a dictionary-like fashion. It also allows certain users to edit those descriptions.</p>
          <p>What is the purpose, you say? Well, I created a <a href="https://www.pvi2.org">website</a> for medical data entry. The information gathered in the website is used for researching the outcomes of patients that suffer from very specific heart conditions. This type of research is very thorough, so the participant nurses are required to fill out forms for each patient undergoing a certain procedure. These forms are quite long, in the range of 300 fields, separated across multiple pages.</p>
          <p>300 fields is a lot of fields for a single content type, but that's how we like it. I used a yet-unreleased module that takes any content type and splits it across as many pages as you want. More on that later.</p>
          <p>I still haven't gotten to the purpose. So whenever the users want to study all the fields at a glance, without having to browse through the actual form, they need a nice dictionary layout of the fields. Initially, I copy/pasted all the definitions into a page and formatted it using &lt;dt&gt; and &lt;dd&gt; tags, but it turns out that these field descriptions are revised quarterly, or sometimes even monthly, due to changes in practices in the health care industry.</p>
          <p>The hell I was allowing the coordinators to touch the CCK fields to change the descriptions, and I wasn't about to hack core to allow them either. Nor was I going to update the fields myself upon request, since my time is better spent doing work. So I sat down to write this module.</p>
