          <h3>DrupalCon DC: Sold Out!</h3>
          <div id="post-date">January 28, 2009</div>
          <p>This morning my manager said: "Victor, I've got good news for you! The company will pay for your conference, plane ticket, hotel, the works!". Yay! I was suddenly the happiest person alive. I quickly went to my computer and loaded up the <a href="http://dc2009.drupalcon.org">DrupalCon</a> website. I felt the blood in the upper part of my body go to my legs when I saw the evil sign that said "Sold Out!".</p>
          <p><strong>Fail.</strong></p>
          <p>I looked for a phone number to call and cry to them until the opened a spot for me, but all I got was an e-mail contact form. Still, I sent an email asking about a waiting list and telling them that I was willing to stand in the cold, under the rain, and look at the conference through a window just for the privilege of being there. Bonnie, from <a href="http://www.developmentseed.org">Development Seed</a> was kind enough to send me to a forum post where people could send messages requesting tickets for people who no longer wanted (or needed) them.</p>
          <p>I'm willing to do a lot for that one-way ticket to drupal happiness. So here's the deal: I'll pay more than what you paid for the ticket if you are willing to sell it to me. Also, I'll talk about your company and/or website(s) to every single person I talk to during the conference. And there's more: I'll also blog about it. Not that my blog is that popular, really, but every little bit helps. And I'll post Twitter messages about it. What else? I'll even take you to dinner, or pay for a few rounds. Throw in some baked goods, also, for good measure.</p>
