          <h3>InnoDB on Ubuntu?</h3>
          <div id="post-date">May 3, 2011</div>
          <p>I'm currently working on a Drupal 6.x website that recently changed its database storage engine to InnoDB. I was not very aware at the time, but it does have some issues while running on Ubuntu.</p>
          <p>Of course, I do all my development locally and I recently upgraded to the shiny new Ubuntu 11.04. For a while I blamed the ridiculously slow speed of this particular database to the OS upgrade, as, for some reason, I had to re-install my entire LAMP stack after the upgrade; the MyISAM to InnoDB switch happened around the same time.</p>
          <p>Something is not right when Views takes minutes to save. Another <a href="http://timverly.com">Drupalista</a> working on the website is using Ubuntu as well, so we decided to look into the matter. We could not find a proper solution right away, but decided that, for sanity's sake, we can just change our local databases to run MyISAM instead. There's no way to do a bulk change of database storage engine, so we came up with the following SQL query:</p>
          <p><code>SELECT CONCAT('ALTER TABLE ',table_schema,'.',table_name,' engine=MyISAM;') FROM information_schema.tables WHERE engine = 'InnoDB' AND table_schema = 'DATABASE_NAME';</code></p>
          <p>Change <em>DATABASE_NAME</em> to the database name, of course. Copy &amp; paste the results into a text editor and remove whatever embellishing characters your MySQL client decides to add to the results table, then save the file with a .sql extension. The result of this is a nice list of queries that will bring back speed into your database life, for the time being.</p>
          <p>I do not know for sure what the problem is, but this seems like a temporary fix. I wonder if anyone in the community has had similar experiences...</p>
          <p>Let me know in the comments.</p>
