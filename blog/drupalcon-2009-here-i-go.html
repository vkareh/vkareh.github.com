          <div id="post-date">February 12, 2009</div>
          <p>Good fortune is on my side. This was more evident when I found out that the DrupalCon guys were starting a wait-list, starting in order from those that posted a request for a ticket.. The fortunate part was that I was one of the very first in the forum. Phew!</p>
          <p>Still, I didn't get my ticket thanks to that wait-list, but because someone that couldn't make it to the conference did the same. I will assume that he went, one by one, FIFO-style, through the list of those who posted in the forum, until he found the next one in line without a ticket. That lucky golden ticket winner was me, and I'm going to Willy Wonka's DrupalCon Factory!</p>
          <p>I'm grateful to <a href="http://kevinbridges.org">Cyberswat</a> for selling me his DrupalCon ticket.</p>
          <p>On yet another fortunate event, my company not only approved me going to the conference, but they paid the airfare, the hotel, and will pay for all my meals while there.</p>
          <p>How cool is that!</p>
