      <h2>Work</h2>
      <p>
        I work at <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en">Red Hat</a> as a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vkareh/">Principal Software Engineer</a>.
        The majority of the projects I work on are related to managed services, particularly of <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift">OpenShift</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some of the projects I work on here are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rosa">Red Hat OpenShift on AWS</a> (ROSA)</li>
        <li><a href="https://console.redhat.com/openshift">OpenShift Cluster Manager</a> (OCM)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Most of my time is spent attending meetings, designing new features (and writing the specs), writing code (mostly in <a href="https://golang.org">Golang</a>), and reviewing my teammates' code (which is usually better than mine).

      <h2>Homesteading</h2>
      <p>
        My family and I live in the countryside and lead a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homesteading">homesteading</a> lifestyle.
        We homeschool our children and actively work towards local food self-sufficiency.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>We try to grow what we eat (fruits, vegetables, eggs).</li>
        <li>What we don't [yet] grow, we source from neighboring farms (meat, dairy, extra fruit).</li>
        <li>What we can't source from neighboring farms, we buy in bulk from local sources (dried beans, wheat grain).</li>
        <li>What can't be produced locally, we import (coffee, chocolate).</li>
        <li>We eat fresh produce only when it's in season.</li>
        <li>We preserve food after harvest to last us through winter.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It's a rewarding lifestyle full of fun challenges.</p>
