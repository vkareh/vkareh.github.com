              <img src="images/architecture.png" alt="Full-scale architecture" title="Full-scale architecture" />
              <p>A good website architecture can simplify the development process and prevent feature creep.</p>
              <p>I will help you create a blueprint of your website so that you are able to follow along the development process. It's your website: know what's in it.</p>

              <h3>Website engineering</h3>
              <img src="images/engineering.png" alt="Website engineering" title="Website engineering" />
              <p>High quality engineering is necessary for a high quality website that's easy to use and maintain.</p>
              <p>From defining the requirements of the project, to bringing a website to completion, I will be part of the process the whole way. That's part of my training as an engineer: understand every step of the process, no guesswork involved.</p>
              <p>Whether your project is a simple module customization or a full-fledged web 2.0 application, the key is a deep understanding of your requirements. Only a professional can guarantee that.</p>
              <p>Let my engineering background take care of your website development process. It's your business: trust only a professional.</p>

              <h3>Modular development</h3>
              <img src="images/development.png" alt="Modular development" title="Modular development" />
              <p>Some ideas are completely new, and some might have solutions that require a bit of tweaking.</p>
              <p>I have been doing Drupal module development for years, and have deep understanding and knowledge about the Drupal API, the hook system, and hundreds of contributed modules.</p>
              <p>Also, it's not enough for me to use someone else's code: I contribute my modules back to the Drupal community. That way, the Drupal community can jump in and add new features and make it better. Everyone wins.</p>
              <p>Let my experience speak for itself: my proven track record of <a href="http://drupal.org/user/144520">published modules</a> has helped thousands of websites implement those ideas. It's your idea: let me help you too.</p>
